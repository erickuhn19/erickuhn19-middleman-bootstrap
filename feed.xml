    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So in my &lt;a href="http://erickuhn19.com/google-io-2016-thoughts/"&gt;last post on Google I/O&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned I was going to explore Firebase and I’ve been doing just that. The Firebase team has great documentation on their site as well as some helpful tutorials. I completed the iOS building a messaging app with Swift. You can find the link &lt;a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-ios-swift"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very cool to see the power behind the SDK and how Firebase can augment so many backend things you would have to build into your API. I followed along but getting to understand all the functions is really where you can unlock Firebase’s true potential. I plan on doing this over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tutorial you learn how to set up the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sync data using the Firebase Realtime Database.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manage Identity and Sign In with Firebase Authentication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store and access files using Firebase Storage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure an application with Firebase Remote Config.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Track application usage flows with Firebase Analytics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Display ads with AdMob.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there were a few issues with the documentation. Nothing a little stackoverflow/github googling couldn’t fix. Here are the fixes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 8: &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37383187/error-in-firebase-ios-codelab-chat-app-tutorial"&gt;stackoverflow link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need to add to the Constants.Swift file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;swift
static let imageUrl = "imageUrl"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All looked good after that and then I caught this error when I complied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;FriendlyChatSwift[7097:353609] &lt;em&gt;** Assertion failure in -[UITableView _endCellAnimationsWithContext:], /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/UIKit_Sim/UIKit-3512.60.7/UITableView.m:1716 2016-05-28 16:38:42.950 FriendlyChatSwift[7097:353609] **&lt;/em&gt; Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Invalid update: invalid number of rows in section 0.  The number of rows contained in an existing section after the update (1) must be equal to the number of rows contained in that section before the update (27), plus or minus the number of rows inserted or deleted from that section (1 inserted, 0 deleted) and plus or minus the number of rows moved into or out of that section (0 moved in, 0 moved out).'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the discussion on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/firebase/friendlychat/issues/25"&gt;Firebase’s github page&lt;/a&gt; on the issue. The answer that ended up working for me came from this source on &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37400316/image-upload-crash-in-firebase-codelabs-friendlychat-tutorial"&gt;stackoverflow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found an error in step 10, use this in the viewDidLoad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;swift
self.remoteConfig = FIRRemoteConfig.remoteConfig()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Google IO 2016" src="/images/googleio2016.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t going to be a full write up of Google I/O 2016. There are many that do a great job of that, you can read &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/gallery/everything-you-need-to-know-from-the-2016-google-io-keynote/"&gt;TechCrunch’s here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/18/11701030/google-io-2016-keynote-highlights-announcements-recap"&gt;The Verge here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2016/05/20/google-io-2016-recap-everything-need-know/#gref"&gt;The Next Web here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to touch on the two things that I am really excited about. The first is Google Home. I’ve been excited about Amazon’s Echo but haven’t jumped in yet. I’ve read and seen examples where the Echo can be a really cool utility because of it’s always listening functionality. I air on the side of Siracusa here &lt;a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/170"&gt;(listen to the ATP 170 to hear his thoughts)&lt;/a&gt; and think that the the full stack integrations with merchants isn’t there yet, so it won’t be able to do the things I really would like it to do. However, if I trust any company to do this really well, it’s Google. Google’s core competency is in big data processing and machine learning which is exactly what this product is meant for. I will 100% be a buyer of this product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only my new Apple TV had the always listening functionality with enhanced microphones. Apple could have already had a horse in this race. Siri on iPhone and Apple Watch isn’t sufficient because the ‘hey siri’ is way too hit or miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marco.org/2016/05/21/avoiding-blackberrys-fate"&gt;Marco Arment writes up a great piece&lt;/a&gt; on his fear that Apple is not focusing enough on the machine learning/AI strategy, where its competitors already have an advantage. Let’s see if Apple opens up a Siri API at WWDC next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other Google IO announcement that is really exciting and I plan on diving in much deeper with, is &lt;a href="https://firebase.google.com/"&gt;Firebase.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Firebase" src="/images/firebase.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firebase was purchased around 18 months ago and this is the &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/18/11704050/google-firebase-baas-facebook-parse-google-io-2016"&gt;first major addition to the platform.&lt;/a&gt; With &lt;a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/"&gt;Parse shutting down&lt;/a&gt; this is a welcome to the developer community that want to rely on back end as a service (BaaS) platforms. I am personally excited and already diving into the documentation to see how I could utilize this service in my next side project. The reason why it’s so intriguing? Google is building this platform to be multi channel: iOS, Android and Web. Back end services are one of those things Google does well and this update to Firebase is going to help fill the void where Parse left off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An interesting announcement was made this week in the payments world. MCX is laying off 30 people and postponing their launch of the CurrentC mobile payment app. You can read about the announcement on &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/16/mcx-postpones-national-rollout-of-apple-pay-rival-currentc-lays-off-30-to-focus-on-banks"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/05/translation_mcx"&gt;John Gruber, on his site Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt; does a comical, yet glaringly true translation of the comments made by the CEO of MCX. And &lt;a href="http://www.pymnts.com/news/mobile-payments/2016/mcx-currentc-mobile-wallet-postponed/"&gt;PYMNTS.com&lt;/a&gt; has a write up about the story that brings up pressing questions to be answered in the mobile payments space:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we’ve learned anything over the last several years when watching the mobile payments field take shape, it’s that absent something that solves a problem for a consumer or adds value to their experience, innovators have nothing left but an empty bank account to show for their efforts. And the longer that it takes for the value exchange to be recognized and that “ignition” to happen, the more likely it is that a superior offer comes along to take its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is essential. The plastic cards have been solving the problems of consumers for years. The next wave of solutions needs to solve a new problem and really add value to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about an &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/chase-pay-and-the-payments-stack-apple-pay-and-opportunity-cost-apply-aggregation-theory/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; I read late last year echoing the same sentiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ll jump straight to the punchline: Chase Pay will fail. Understanding why, though, is interesting, and the fact this exists at all should be worrying from an Apple perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First off, like most products produced by companies which don’t owe their existence or financial performance to the quality of the user experience, the product already sounds like a complete mess: you pay with QR codes from the Chase app, except for when you need QR codes from the MCX app, and hey, you can sometimes take a photo of your check and not use QR codes as well! It’s ridiculous, and as I’ve said about payments from the beginning, whatever product succeeds credit cards has to be significantly easier to use; inertia is a powerful thing, which means the delta of improvement in convenience in particular (plus security and usefulness and all the other factors that you can attribute to a product) has to be massive. And, given just how convenient credit cards are, a new payment solution has to basically have zero friction — and this Chase product sounds like it has a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think these are all the right conversations to be having. Solving the needs of consumers has to be the focus in mobile payments and will be the catalyst to drive adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple shortens app review times</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was been much talk about Apple competing and generating revenue as a service based business. If you haven't read the &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/apples-organizational-crossroads/"&gt;Stratechery blog post&lt;/a&gt; on it, it's a must read. Now there are reports that Apple is significantly cutting app review times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-12/apple-shortens-app-review-times-in-push-to-boost-service-sales"&gt;From Bloomberg :&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. has cut the approval time for new submissions to its App Store from more than a week to less than two days, part of a broader push to increase revenue from services including mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a long awaited step in the right direction, however Apple still needs to focus on improving discoverability in the app store. Perhaps a purge of the massive volume of terrible apps in the store, especially the ones that haven't been updated in years. Quality &amp;gt; Quantity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to Marco and Underscore talk about it on &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+Fgm1ElCi0"&gt;Under the Radar: 27: Fast App Review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Google has announced today it's launching a keyboard for iOS called &lt;a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/gboard-search-gifs-emojis-keyboard.html"&gt;Gboard.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="GBoard" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ALxOB9Ab_9A/VzQuQB1vl5I/AAAAAAAASRo/0gE-Dij5TIEvUIY3zDcvQtivBEQ23VkuwCLcB/s1600/gboard_gif_regularSearch.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/12/google-launches-gboard-an-ios-keyboard-that-lets-you-search-without-a-browser/"&gt;TechCrunch:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of course, the most interesting feature of this keyboard is its direct integration with Google’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By tapping the included “G” icon, you’re able to immediately search Google without exiting your keyboard and launching a browser or the Google app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This allows you to easily search for things like flight times, news articles, restaurant and business listings, weather and more right from your keyboard, then just tap to paste that information into your chat. (You’ll need to give the app access to your location the first time you launch this feature.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm surprised this move did not come sooner, as Microsoft has already realized the power of integrating itself into the keyboard. The SwiftKey aquisition was a telling sign that this space is going to start to heat up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The not so obvious problem for iOS developers</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently my new company provided me with an 16GB iPhone 6S. I did everything in my power to circumvent this model, as I was using a iPhone 6 with 64GB at a 70% capacity. Switching to the 16GB seemed unfathomable. Since two iPhones in my pocket was not going to be an option, I told myself I would make this work. First, I needed to make some ground rules or this was going to be a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with creating a new phone and not installing my iCloud back up. I had 244 non-Apple apps on my phone and knew I needed to narrow this down. Only my most used apps were going to make the cut. This was a herculean challenge but a good exercise to think about what I was receiving the most value from. As of this writing I only downloaded 40 but I feel like I cut too many corners. One thing I had going for me is I don’t use any music on my phone since I use Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most glaring problem I have with this new set up is my new trepidation to try out new apps. Is this a problem other people think about? In the past I would try out apps on a whim and keep them around even if it’s a one time use case. Now my new world view is drastically different because of the limited space. This makes me uncomfortable since I ‘m a Product Manager in the mobile space. Testing a large number of apps is part of the job description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve given my personal account how this phone affects me. Let’s think about it in a broader context and what are the ripple effects for the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve read all the reports about the amount of apps the average person uses per day &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/22/consumers-spend-85-of-time-on-smartphones-in-apps-but-only-5-apps-see-heavy-use/#.vyo3cp:5bJy"&gt;(5)&lt;/a&gt; and how many she will keep on her phone &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/09/05/most-apps-download-countries/"&gt;(25)&lt;/a&gt;, but that is just data. The important question is why are people limiting their app consumption. Is it a personal preference or a choice they’re forced to make? This distinction is important as the app ecosystem’s vibrancy of new apps depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s run with the idea that the vast majority of people own a 16GB iPhone. This is a safe assumption thanks to some data from the UK that says &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-storage-data-market-share-2014-12?r=UK&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;91% of Telefonica users have the 16GB model.&lt;/a&gt;
Let’s make another assumption and say the majority of those people run into a shortage of space on a frequent basis. If this is the case, then the obvious statement is Apple is not giving the user the best experience. The less obvious statement. App developers are experiencing a constraint in growth outside of their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Apple launched app thinning and reduced the size of OS updates. But that won’t solve the problem overnight. A simple thought experiment. If someone needed to choose between photos of their loved ones and the newest app. Which would they choose? The problem for app developers is, why do they have to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an important observation as we increasingly rely on software to make improvements in our lives. As a Product Manager, it is more important than ever to bring real value to your users. Your not only competing for the user’s time and attention. You are competing for space on their phone.&lt;/p&gt;
