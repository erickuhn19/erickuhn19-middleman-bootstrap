    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was been much talk about Apple competing and generating revenue as a service based business. If you haven't read the &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/apples-organizational-crossroads/"&gt;Stratechery blog post&lt;/a&gt; on it, it's a must read. Now there are reports that Apple is significantly cutting app review times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-12/apple-shortens-app-review-times-in-push-to-boost-service-sales"&gt;From Bloomberg :&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. has cut the approval time for new submissions to its App Store from more than a week to less than two days, part of a broader push to increase revenue from services including mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a long awaited step in the right direction, however Apple still needs to focus on improving discoverability in the app store. Perhaps a purge of the massive volume of terrible apps in the store, especially the ones that haven't been updated in years. Quality &amp;gt; Quantity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to Marco and Underscore talk about it on &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+Fgm1ElCi0"&gt;Under the Radar: 27: Fast App Review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Google has announced today it's launching a keyboard for iOS called &lt;a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/gboard-search-gifs-emojis-keyboard.html"&gt;Gboard.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="GBoard" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ALxOB9Ab_9A/VzQuQB1vl5I/AAAAAAAASRo/0gE-Dij5TIEvUIY3zDcvQtivBEQ23VkuwCLcB/s1600/gboard_gif_regularSearch.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/12/google-launches-gboard-an-ios-keyboard-that-lets-you-search-without-a-browser/"&gt;TechCrunch:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of course, the most interesting feature of this keyboard is its direct integration with Google’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By tapping the included “G” icon, you’re able to immediately search Google without exiting your keyboard and launching a browser or the Google app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This allows you to easily search for things like flight times, news articles, restaurant and business listings, weather and more right from your keyboard, then just tap to paste that information into your chat. (You’ll need to give the app access to your location the first time you launch this feature.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm surprised this move did not come sooner, as Microsoft has already realized the power of integrating itself into the keyboard. The SwiftKey aquisition was a telling sign that this space is going to start to heat up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The not so obvious problem for iOS developers</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently my new company provided me with an 16GB iPhone 6S. I did everything in my power to circumvent this model, as I was using a iPhone 6 with 64GB at a 70% capacity. Switching to the 16GB seemed unfathomable. Since two iPhones in my pocket was not going to be an option, I told myself I would make this work. First, I needed to make some ground rules or this was going to be a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with creating a new phone and not installing my iCloud back up. I had 244 non-Apple apps on my phone and knew I needed to narrow this down. Only my most used apps were going to make the cut. This was a herculean challenge but a good exercise to think about what I was receiving the most value from. As of this writing I only downloaded 40 but I feel like I cut too many corners. One thing I had going for me is I don’t use any music on my phone since I use Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most glaring problem I have with this new set up is my new trepidation to try out new apps. Is this a problem other people think about? In the past I would try out apps on a whim and keep them around even if it’s a one time use case. Now my new world view is drastically different because of the limited space. This makes me uncomfortable since I ‘m a Product Manager in the mobile space. Testing a large number of apps is part of the job description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve given my personal account how this phone affects me. Let’s think about it in a broader context and what are the ripple effects for the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve read all the reports about the amount of apps the average person uses per day &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/22/consumers-spend-85-of-time-on-smartphones-in-apps-but-only-5-apps-see-heavy-use/#.vyo3cp:5bJy"&gt;(5)&lt;/a&gt; and how many she will keep on her phone &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/09/05/most-apps-download-countries/"&gt;(25)&lt;/a&gt;, but that is just data. The important question is why are people limiting their app consumption. Is it a personal preference or a choice they’re forced to make? This distinction is important as the app ecosystem’s vibrancy of new apps depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s run with the idea that the vast majority of people own a 16GB iPhone. This is a safe assumption thanks to some data from the UK that says &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-storage-data-market-share-2014-12?r=UK&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;91% of Telefonica users have the 16GB model.&lt;/a&gt;
Let’s make another assumption and say the majority of those people run into a shortage of space on a frequent basis. If this is the case, then the obvious statement is Apple is not giving the user the best experience. The less obvious statement. App developers are experiencing a constraint in growth outside of their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Apple launched app thinning and reduced the size of OS updates. But that won’t solve the problem overnight. A simple thought experiment. If someone needed to choose between photos of their loved ones and the newest app. Which would they choose? The problem for app developers is, why do they have to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an important observation as we increasingly rely on software to make improvements in our lives. As a Product Manager, it is more important than ever to bring real value to your users. Your not only competing for the user’s time and attention. You are competing for space on their phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started my programming journey almost a year ago and I’ve recently had a change in philosophy. I’ve decided to exclusively develop iOS apps using the new Swift language Apple debuted last year. This decision did not come lightly. Many conversations, read blog posts and internal pondering if this would be the right move took place before I came to the decision to invest my limited time in learning iOS development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After extensive thought on this subject, I’ve dove in head first to learn as fast as I possibly can. My knowledge of web apps and understanding of Object Oriented Programming Languages such as Ruby have been extremely useful in learning Swift concepts. Xcode and the entire development process of iOS is so different, but the more I learn the more my own personal experiences with apps is helping me further my understanding. This is truly an exciting time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why did I come to this conclusion? My wife originally planted the idea in my head when I first started to learn to code. It was a profound yet simple argument. The vast majority of the time she is on her phone, and the majority of that time is spent in apps, so why don’t you learn how to build these? I’m paraphrasing but when I think about it, it’s also the case for my own behavior. I spend the majority of my time in apps and I’m generally most excited about the possibility of what native apps have the capability of doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I shrugged this off because I was in the infancy of my coding journey and the majority of the resources I found were for the web and Ruby on Rails. Just to be clear, I 100% don’t regret starting with the web. It was essential to understand the fundamental layers of how web frameworks work and this has and will continue to be profound in my iOS development. However, the argument she made began to creep into my mind which became inescapable to my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I could get all &lt;a href="www.ben-evans.com/"&gt;Benedict Evan’s&lt;/a&gt; and quote statistical data on why mobile is taking over the world or as he explains it “The smartphone is the new sun,” but seriously if you haven’t read his work, you should. I’ll leave him to make the technical arguments to why mobile is the most important piece of hardware in the world and to the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision became clear. To build solutions that solved my own problems I needed to develop software on the platform I spend the most time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was writing about my Ruby on Rails coding journey, I will begin to do that for Swift and iOS development. Writing technical blog posts is to help me better understand the concepts I’m learning and has been enormously helpful. It was the sole reason for taking the part-time work at Codecademy as an Advisor. The experience of helping people to fix a bug or point them on the right path is a blog post in itself and I’ve loved the experience so far. I’ll get to that another time. For now, expect to see this blog full of Swift and iOS development post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t noticed but I’ve done an overhaul of my website and blog. I’m not done with making tweaks, honestly I still have a lot to do but I wanted to just ship it and make the changes as I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is built on a totally different framework than before. The last site was a blog built with Ruby on Rails. I used my personal blog to test my Rails development skills and it served a useful purpose. It was a simple app that I could maintain to just get into the Rails framework. However, its time has come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a project at work (I’ll get to my new job in a later post) I needed to build a new front end site for the project I’m working on. I’ve conceptually moved away from using Wordpress since I’ve taught myself to code using Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, jQuery and the Bootstrap framework. So building a Wordpress site with blog just wasn’t an option for me. I ended up just customizing a Bootstrap theme in pure HTML, CSS and jQuery out of necessity, but I knew this was not sustainable for a larger scale site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself coming across Static Site Generators such as Middleman and Jekyll and instantly fell in love with these frameworks. Ok, maybe not in love but I really liked the concept. I realized I didn’t need to build a Rails web app to serve a static site like a marketing site, but the features of Rails such as partials and gems were so appealing. After doing way more research than I would have liked I settled on Middleman, partially because of its connection to Thoughtbot (I’m a big fan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that it was time for a change to my personal site and was excited to test out the new framework. Also, I want to have a go-to front end static site generator framework that can serve up my marketing sites with blog for future projects. Did I mention I am serving this site on Github Pages for free? No longer do I need to pay some absurd monthly fee  for specialized managed Wordpress host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’m not going to get into the finer details of Middleman in this post. For now I’ll say that I’m very happy I’ve made the switch and will certainly be using it for my future projects, plus I probably need to redesign the original work project as it's continuing to grow in scope and needs a nice framework to develop it efficently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hiatus from writing regularly is officially over.&lt;/p&gt;
